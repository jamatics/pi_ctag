## Description

### Abstract

This code developed in Octave demonstrates how to measure the Dynamic
Posture Stability Index (DPSI) of the subject performing mobility tasks

The current entry point is [computePI.m](computePI.m).

```octave
computePI("[path_to]/subject_xx_run_xx_balance.csv", "[path_to]/subject_xx_info.yaml", "[path_to]/")
```

The two parameters are:

- `subject_xx_run_xx_balance.csv`: a `csv` file containing the 3d ground 
reaction forces from left and right hand side force plate, assuming the 
first column is a timestamp in second.

- `subject_xx_info.yaml`: yaml file containing subject anthropomorphic related information.

We are expecting values for left and right hand forces plate in 
the form of the 3d force vector(x, y, z).

### Variables

* Fx (ground medial-lateral forces), 
* Fy (ground anterior-posterior forces), 
* Fz (ground vertical reaction forces),
* Mx,My,Mz(momentums of the forces) (Optional for future use)
* BWs1: Body weights of the subject 1.
* reactForce_x_l || reactForce_x_r: Fx of both forceplates.
* reactForxe_y_r || reactForce_y_r: Fy of both forceplates.
* reactForce_z_r || reactForce_z_r: Fz of both forceplates.
* DPSI: Dynamic Postural Stability Index.
* maxDPSI: maximum value of DPSI matrices.
* meanDPSI: mean value of DPSI matrices.
* areaDPSI: sum of the values of DPSI matrices.
* areaDPSIvsTiime: This value is the areaDPSI value divided by the 
time (25 seconds). This value is scaled in the next line: it is divided by 100.
* [Maxat, maxTime] [minat, minTime]: Matrices created to find the matching 
time value of the maximum and minimum DPSI and time instance of maximum and
minumum time.

## Initial code structure

The current documentation may not be updated.

Brief structure is listed below:

| Metric | Input | Expected units | Variable name | Format | Data Example | Input file | information MAP |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Balance | Ground Reaction Force | Newtons | reactForces | Double | 10.5, 34.6, .... | subject_xx_run_xx_balance.csv | portableForcePlate(CSIC) > preProcess > inputFile |

Octave algorithm to obtain DPSI (max, min, min time instance, max time instance,
DPSI area vs time) for human mobility in the testbed.

The main simple algorithm uses following functions to obtain the desired:

* `max` function [source octave]
* `min` function [source octave]
* `mean` function [source octave]
* `sum` function [source octave]
* `store_vector` [source EB]
* `read_simple_yaml` [source EB]
